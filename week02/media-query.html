        <h2>Alma 32:34</h2>
        <p>
          And now, behold, is your knowledge perfect? Yea, your knowledge is
          perfect in that thing, and your faith is dormant; and this because you
          know, for ye know that the word hath swelled your souls, and ye also
          know that it hath sprouted up, that your understanding doth begin to
          be enlightened, and your mind doth begin to expand.

          Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort
          those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God
          at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in,
          even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, and be numbered with
          those of the first resurrection, that ye may have eternal life
