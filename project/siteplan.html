        <h2>Site name</h2>
        <p>
          The name of this website - Coisas do Cerrado - was chosen to clearly
          reflect its central objective, which is to promote its biodiversity
          and raise awareness of the importance of its conservation.
        </p>

        <h2>Site purpose</h2>
        <p>
          The Cerrado is a region characterized by exceptional biodiversity and
          considered the richest savanna in the world. It has a seasonal
          tropical climate with two well-defined seasons (dry and rainy), soils
          generally poor in nutrients and a wide variety of vegetation. It is of
          great hydrological importance, as it houses the springs of three of
          the largest hydrographic basins in Brazil. In recent years, there has
          been an increase in the frequency of illegal fires and deforestation.
          As a result, many animal and plant species are entering the process of
          extinction, compromising the biodiversity that is characteristic of
          this biome. Given this situation, it is more than urgent to publicize
          the biodiversity of this biome and the process of destruction to which
          they are being affected, in order to unite the necessary forces to
          prevent them from continuing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given this context, the site - Coisas do Cerrado - has the purpose
          serve as an <strong>informational and awareness portal</strong> for
          the Cerrado biome. Its scope includes publishing
          <strong>detailed articles</strong> on biodiversity and hydrological
          importance, raising <strong>civic awareness</strong> about threats
          (fires and deforestation), and providing
          <strong>practical resources</strong>
          for ecotourism and conservation engagement efforts.
